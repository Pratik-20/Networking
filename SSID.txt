Let’s dive into what an SSID is:

An SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of a Wi-Fi network. It serves as a unique identifier that allows devices to connect to that specific network. When you’re at a coffee shop or any other location with Wi-Fi, you’ll see SSIDs like “Coffee Shop Wi-Fi” or “Airport WiFi.” These names help users distinguish between different networks in the area and connect to the right one1234.

Here are some key points about SSIDs:

An SSID can be up to 32 characters long and is case-sensitive.
Router manufacturers often provide default SSIDs like “Linksys” or “Netgear,” but you can customize it if you have administrative access to your Wi-Fi network.
Devices remember SSIDs they’ve connected to before, which can lead to complications if there are multiple networks with the same name.
If a network is secured (using WPA2 or another encryption), users need the passphrase to connect.

Definition: 
An SSID is the technical term for the name of a Wi-Fi network. When you scan for Wi-Fi networks on a Wi-Fi-enabled device, the list of names you see represents different SSIDs nearby. These unique identifiers allow devices to distinguish one wireless network from another1.


Functionality:
SSIDs serve as network names, allowing devices to connect to the correct Wi-Fi network.
They’re used by all types of Wi-Fi access points, including public networks and home Wi-Fi setups.
Router manufacturers often provide default SSIDs like “Linksys” or “Netgear,” but you can customize it if you have administrative access to your Wi-Fi network.
An SSID can be up to 32 characters long, case-sensitive, and may include spaces and special symbols.
If a network is secured (using WPA2 or another encryption), users need the passphrase before connecting234.

Multiple Networks with the Same SSID:
If there are multiple Wi-Fi networks with the same SSID, devices will try to connect based on signal strength or the first network they encounter.
If those networks have different passphrases, connection problems may arise.
It’s best to avoid using the same SSID as your neighbor to prevent such issues.
