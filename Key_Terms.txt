ILL (Internet Leased Line): An Internet leased line is a dedicated connection that provides high-speed internet access. Unlike broadband, which is shared among multiple users,
                           an ILL is not shared and offers consistent performance without bandwidth reduction. It’s commonly used for businesses and organizations that require reliable and secure connectivity.

MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching): MPLS is a private network connection that links data centers and branch offices. It’s typically managed by service providers who guarantee network performance,
                                     quality, and availability. While MPLS is reliable and secure, it can be expensive. Traditional MPLS-based WANs often backhaul traffic through a centralized data center, which can impact performance and user experience.

SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network): SD-WAN is an overlay network that manages multiple types of connections, including MPLS, broadband, and LTE. 
                                            It dynamically routes traffic over the best path in real time, improving performance and allowing direct internet access for cloud-bound traffic at branch locations.

Broadband Internet: Broadband internet refers to standard internet connectivity provided by ISPs. It’s essential for connecting branches directly to the internet,
                   especially as more applications move to the cloud. Bandwidth demands are increasing due to connected devices and bandwidth-intensive apps.
