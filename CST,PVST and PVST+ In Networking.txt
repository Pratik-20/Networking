CST,PVST and PVST+ In Networking

-------------------------------------------------------


Common Spanning Tree (CST):
CST is the oldest version of spanning tree and is defined in the 802.1D standard.
It calculates a single spanning tree for all VLANs in the network.
In CST, there is only one root bridge for the entire network, regardless of the VLANs.
CST is not aware of VLANs and treats all VLANs as a single broadcast domain.
It’s a legacy protocol and not commonly used in modern networks.
Per VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST):
PVST is an enhancement over CST and is the default on Cisco switches.
Unlike CST, PVST calculates a separate spanning tree for each VLAN.
Each VLAN can have its own root bridge, which allows better load balancing and utilization of network resources.
For example, SW1 could be the root bridge for VLAN 10, while SW2 could be the root bridge for VLAN 20.
PVST ensures that interfaces are not unnecessarily blocked for all VLANs.
It’s more efficient than CST but still has some limitations.



Rapid PVST+ (RPVST+):
Beginning from Cisco IOS 15.2 (4)E release, the default STP mode is RPVST+.
RPVST+ is an evolution of PVST+ with faster convergence times.
Like PVST+, it calculates a separate spanning tree for each VLAN.
RPVST+ improves network stability and reduces downtime during topology changes.
It’s widely used in modern Cisco networks.


In summary:

PVST+ (or simply PVST) is the default on Cisco switches, calculating a separate spanning tree for each VLAN.
RPVST+ is an enhanced version of PVST+ with faster convergence.
CST is the legacy spanning tree that calculates a single spanning tree for all VLANs.
