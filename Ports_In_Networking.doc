Port numbers play a crucial role in network communication. Let’s explore what they are:

Definition:

A port number is a logical address assigned to each application or process that uses a network or the Internet to communicate.
It uniquely identifies a network-based application on a computer.
Each application or program is allocated a 16-bit integer port number.

Well-Known Ports:

The port numbers in the range from 0 to 1023 (0 to 210 - 1) are known as well-known ports or system ports.
These ports are used by system processes that provide widely used types of network services.

Examples of well-known ports include:

Port 7: Echo Protocol (used for testing connectivity).
Port 9: Discard Protocol (discards any data sent to it).
Port 13: Daytime Protocol (returns the current date and time).
Port 17: Quote of the Day (QOTD) (provides a random quote).
Port 80: HTTP (used for web browsing).
Port 443: HTTPS (secure web browsing over SSL/TLS).
Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System).
Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, used for email).
Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell, for secure remote access).
Port 21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
Port 110: POP3 (Post Office Protocol, for retrieving email).
Port 161: SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
Port 389: LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
Port 3389: RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

Registered and Dynamic Ports:

Ports beyond the well-known range (1024 and above) are either registered or dynamic.
Registered ports are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for specific purposes but are not standardized or widely used.
Dynamic ports are used for temporary connections and are dynamically allocated by the operating system.

Q.1: What is Port?
Answer:

Port is a logical address of a 16-bit unsigned integer that is allotted to every application on the computer that uses the internet to send or receive data. It ranges from 0 to 65535.


Q.2: What is the Socket Address?
Answer:

Socket Address is the combination of IP Address and Port Number. It is used in communication between two differnt applications/services.

Q. 3: Why Port Number is used?
Answer:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Port Number or Port is used to uniquely identify any appication/services running on the same device.


Practical Application of Ports
As all of this activity is happening behind the scenes, we weren’t able to see how the IP address and port numbers were used. To cure this problem, we need to learn about Netstat utility.

Netstat stands for network statistics and it’s a command line tool that is used to display the current network connections and port activity on our computer.

In command promp use below command to check current network connections:

C:\Users\PTHORAWADE>netstat -n

Active Connections

  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State
  TCP    127.0.0.1:14766        127.0.0.1:50881        TIME_WAIT
  TCP    127.0.0.1:14766        127.0.0.1:51137        TIME_WAIT
  TCP    127.0.0.1:14766        127.0.0.1:51475        FIN_WAIT_2
  TCP    127.0.0.1:33000        127.0.0.1:51495        ESTABLISHED
