Let's explore the differences between `ping` and `ping -t`:

1. **Ping**:
   - The `ping` command is used to test the reachability of a host and measure the round-trip time (RTT) between the local machine and a remote address or machine.
   - When you execute the `ping` command, it sends a small amount of data (an ICMP packet) to the destination host and waits for a response.
   - If the system can establish a connection, it reports the "round trip time" for each packet.
   - **Use Case**: Primarily used to test connectivity between devices and measure network latency¹³.

2. **Ping -t**:
   - The `ping -t` command is specific to Windows operating systems.
   - Unlike the regular `ping`, which sends a fixed number of packets, `ping -t` sends continuous pings until you manually stop it.
   - It's useful for monitoring network stability over time or checking if a host remains reachable.
   - **Use Case**: Monitoring network availability and stability⁵.

In summary, `ping` is used for one-time testing, while `ping -t` continuously sends pings until you stop it. Both commands help diagnose network issues and measure latency. 😊🌐
