Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)

Definition:
LLDP is an IEEE-standard (802.1AB) Layer 2 protocol.
Unlike CDP, which is specific to Cisco devices, LLDP is vendor-neutral and works across various networking equipment.
It allows devices to advertise their identity, capabilities, and neighboring devices on a local area network (LAN).

How It Works:

LLDP operates at Layer 2 (data link layer) and helps identify network components in the immediate area.
Devices exchange information using TLVs (Type-Length-Value) to discover neighboring devices.

Common TLVs include:

System name and description
Port name and description
IP management address
VLAN information
Capabilities of the neighbor device
MAC address
MDI (Media Dependent Interface) power
Link aggregation details


LLDP Commands:

To enable LLDP globally on a Cisco switch: lldp run


To configure the LLDP transmission interval (default is 30 seconds):
interface <interface-name>
  lldp transmit

Packet Format:

LLDP information is transmitted via Ethernet frames at fixed intervals.
Each frame contains an LLDP Data Unit (LLDPDU), which consists of TLV structures.
Compulsory TLVs in an LLDP frame include:
Chassis ID
Port ID
Time to Live (TTL)

Applications of LLDP:

Used in data center bridging requirements.
Advertises Power over Ethernet (PoE) capabilities.

Advantages of LLDP:

Vendor-neutral: LLDP works on both Cisco and non-Cisco devices.
Open standard: Recommended by Cisco and supported by various vendors.
LLDP-MED extension: Provides additional features beyond CDP.

Remember, LLDP enhances network visibility and promotes interoperability across different devices! üåêüîç
