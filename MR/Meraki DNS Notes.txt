Let’s discuss the importance of DNS configuration in Meraki devices and address the issue of misconfigured DNS.

DNS Importance in Meraki: DNS (Domain Name System) plays a crucial role in Meraki devices. Here are some key points:

Dashboard Communication: 
Meraki devices use DNS servers to communicate with the Meraki dashboard. Proper DNS configuration ensures that the device can connect to the cloud-based dashboard for management and monitoring.

Internet Connectivity: 
DNS servers are essential for resolving domain names to IP addresses. Without proper DNS settings, Meraki devices may struggle to access external resources on the internet.

Content Filtering and Security: 
DNS is used to load content lists for features like content filtering and security. Accurate DNS settings are necessary for these features to function correctly.

VPN Connections: 
DNS resolution is critical for establishing VPN connections between Meraki devices and remote sites.

Addressing Misconfigured DNS: 

If you encounter a “DNS is misconfigured” alert, consider the following steps:

Check Configuration: 
Verify that your DNS settings are correctly configured on the Meraki device. Ensure that both primary and secondary DNS server fields are populated1.

Caching Issues: 
Sometimes, even when the configuration is correct, caching issues can cause false alerts. Wait a couple of hours to see if the alert resolves on its own2.

Firmware Updates: 
Ensure that your Meraki device is running the latest firmware version. Sometimes, updating the firmware can resolve such issues.
Remember that DNS settings on Meraki devices affect the device itself (for dashboard communication) but not client devices. Client devices receive DNS settings via DHCP2. If you continue to face issues, consider reaching out to Meraki support for further assistance.
