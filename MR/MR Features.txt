MR Features:

1. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) and Guest Access Policies:
   - BYOD policies allow employees to use personal devices for work.
   - Guest access policies control network access for visitors or external users.

2. Application Traffic Shaping:
   - Shapes network traffic to prioritize critical applications.
   - Ensures efficient bandwidth utilization and performance.

3. Enterprise Security:
   - Comprehensive security measures for an organizationâ€™s network.
   - Includes firewalls, intrusion detection, and encryption.

4. WIDS/WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention System):
   - Monitors and protects against unauthorized wireless access.
   - Detects and prevents security threats in Wi-Fi networks.

5. Location Analytics:
   - Uses Wi-Fi data to analyze user movement within a physical space.
   - Helps optimize layouts, marketing, and resource allocation.

6. Wireless Health:
   - Monitors Wi-Fi network performance and health.
   - Identifies issues and ensures reliable connectivity.

7. DNS Layer Protection (Umbrella Integration):

IPSK without Radius:

- Identity Preshared Key (PSK):
  - Assign policies based on PSK.
  - No RADIUS server needed.
  - Single SSID for multiple use cases.

Imagine connecting three devices to a Meraki MR access point:

BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) - Company Employee:
Traditionally, we would create separate SSIDs (network names) for each type of device (e.g., BYOD, Sensor, Guest). This allows us to apply different access control lists (ACLs) based on the device type.
Sensor (IoT Sensor):
Similarly, weâ€™d create a different SSID for IoT sensors.
Guest (Visitors):
Guests would have their own SSID as well.
However, Meraki offers a convenient feature: Instead of managing multiple SSIDs, we can create just one SSID. The key lies in using different preshared keys (PSKs) for each device type. Each PSK corresponds to a specific ACL, allowing devices to connect securely to the AP/Wi-Fi.

For example, the passkeys could be:

BYOD: PSK1 - XXXXY1
Sensor: PSK2 - XXXXYY2
Guest: PSK3 - XXXXYYY3

This simplifies the process and ensures efficient connectivity without the need for multiple SSIDs

Local Authentication:

- The Meraki Local Auth feature provides an alternative authentication method for connecting to 802.1X-protected SSIDs.
- Unlike traditional RADIUS-based authentication, it doesnâ€™t rely on external RADIUS servers.
- Useful when RADIUS servers are remote or unreachable.

How It Works:

1. Username/Password Caching (Password Auth):
   - When a user attempts to connect via 802.1X, the MR access point verifies their existence and authorization against a configured LDAP server.
   - If successful, it caches a hash of the userâ€™s credentials.
   - If the LDAP server becomes unreachable, the MR access point consults its cache for authentication.

2. Certificate Caching (Certificate Auth):
   - The MR and client mutually authenticate using SSL certificates.
   - MR uses a certificate signed by IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1.
   - Clients use their own certificates.
   - Optionally, you can check certificate revocation status via an OCSP responder.

Remember, with Meraki Local Auth, you get 802.1X without the need for an external RADIUS server! You can also verify if the certificate belongs to a valid WiFi user/device using an LDAP server. ðŸ˜Š
