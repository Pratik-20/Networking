Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

Definition:
STP is an IEEE 802.1d protocol designed to prevent loops in a Local Area Network (LAN).
It ensures that there is only one active path between any two network devices.
By creating a loop-free topology, STP prevents broadcast storms and network congestion.

How It Works:

STP initializes by selecting a root bridge (usually the switch with the lowest Bridge ID).
Each switch then calculates the least-cost path to the root bridge.
Ports are classified as root, designated, or blocked based on their role in the spanning tree.
Blocked ports prevent loops by disabling redundant paths.

Pros and Cons:

Pros:

Ensures network stability by preventing loops.
Automatically adapts to changes in the network topology.

Cons:

Consumes bandwidth due to blocked ports.
Can cause suboptimal path selection.


EtherChannels:

EtherChannels aggregate multiple physical links into a single logical link.
They allow STP to use the full available bandwidth across these links.
EtherChannels prevent STP from blocking unused ports.
