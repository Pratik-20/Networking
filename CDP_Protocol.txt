Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)

Definition:
CDP is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 protocol.
It provides visibility into the physical topology of directly connected devices.
CDP runs on all Cisco-manufactured equipment.

How It Works:
CDP packets are sent periodically (default interval: 60 seconds).
Devices advertise information about themselves, including hardware, software, and device names.
CDP frames use multicast address 0100.0ccc.cccc.
Switches do not forward CDP packets; they process them locally.

CDP Versions:
CDPv1: Collects basic device information connected to the next hop.
CDPv2: Enhanced version with features like native VLAN mismatch detection, duplex state comparison, and faster error reporting.
CDPv2 frames can be understood by both v1 and v2 devices.

Disabling CDP:
To disable CDP globally: no cdp run.
To check CDP neighbors: show cdp neighbors.

Remember that CDP only works on directly connected interfaces, providing valuable insights into the network topology!
