Practical Application of Ports
As all of this activity is happening behind the scenes, we weren’t able to see how the IP address and port numbers were used. To cure this problem, we need to learn about Netstat utility.

Netstat stands for network statistics and it’s a command line tool that is used to display the current network connections and port activity on our computer.

In command promp use below command to check current network connections:

C:\Users\PTHORAWADE>netstat -n

Active Connections

  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State
  TCP    127.0.0.1:14766        127.0.0.1:50881        TIME_WAIT
  TCP    127.0.0.1:14766        127.0.0.1:51137        TIME_WAIT
  TCP    127.0.0.1:14766        127.0.0.1:51475        FIN_WAIT_2
  TCP    127.0.0.1:33000        127.0.0.1:51495        ESTABLISHED

Here are the most common:
netstat -a : Displays all active connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening.

netstat -b : Displays the binary (executable) program’s name involved in creating each connection or listening port.

netstat -e : Displays ethernet statistics, such as the number of bytes and packets sent and received.

netstat -f : Displays fully qualified domain names for foreign addresses (only available on Windows Vista and newer operating systems).

netstat -i : Displays network interfaces and their statistics.

netstat -m : Displays the memory statistics for the networking code (STREAMS statistics on Solaris).

Displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections.

NETSTAT [-a] [-b] [-e] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-o] [-p proto] [-r] [-s] [-t] [-x] [-y] [interval]

  -a            Displays all connections and listening ports.
  -b            Displays the executable involved in creating each connection or
                listening port. In some cases well-known executables host
                multiple independent components, and in these cases the
                sequence of components involved in creating the connection
                or listening port is displayed. In this case the executable
                name is in [] at the bottom, on top is the component it called,
                and so forth until TCP/IP was reached. Note that this option
                can be time-consuming and will fail unless you have sufficient
                permissions.
  -e            Displays Ethernet statistics. This may be combined with the -s
                option.
  -f            Displays Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) for foreign
                addresses.
  -i            Displays the time spent by a TCP connection in its current state.
  -n            Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.
  -o            Displays the owning process ID associated with each connection.
  -p proto      Shows connections for the protocol specified by proto; proto
                may be any of: TCP, UDP, TCPv6, or UDPv6.  If used with the -s
                option to display per-protocol statistics, proto may be any of:
                IP, IPv6, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, TCPv6, UDP, or UDPv6.
  -q            Displays all connections, listening ports, and bound
                nonlistening TCP ports. Bound nonlistening ports may or may not
                be associated with an active connection.
  -r            Displays the routing table.
  -s            Displays per-protocol statistics.  By default, statistics are
                shown for IP, IPv6, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, TCPv6, UDP, and UDPv6;
                the -p option may be used to specify a subset of the default.
  -t            Displays the current connection offload state.
  -x            Displays NetworkDirect connections, listeners, and shared
                endpoints.
  -y            Displays the TCP connection template for all connections.
                Cannot be combined with the other options.
  interval      Redisplays selected statistics, pausing interval seconds
                between each display.  Press CTRL+C to stop redisplaying
                statistics.  If omitted, netstat will print the current
                configuration information once.
