Letâ€™s dive into the details of these IP configuration commands:

ipconfig:
When you run ipconfig without any parameters in the Command Prompt, it displays information about all network adapters on your Windows computer.
This includes the following details:
IPv4 Address: The local IP address assigned to your computer.
IPv6 Address: The newer version of IP address that supports a larger address space.
Subnet Mask: Determines the network portion of the IP address.
Default Gateway: The IP address of the router or gateway that connects your local network to the internet.


ipconfig /release:
Running this command releases the IPv4 address of all network adapters.
If you want to release the IPv6 address, use ipconfig /release6.
To release the IP address for a specific adapter, type ipconfig /release [adapter].


ipconfig /renew:
After releasing the old IP address, you can use this command to request a new IP address for the client.
It renews the DHCP configuration for all adapters.
For a specific adapter, type ipconfig /renew [adapter].
